## First Write

On January 25<sup>th</sup>, I started writing a Flutter app to let users practice Japanese Kana. Next day, January 26<sup>th</sup> is a national holiday in India. I used my morning and some of the afternoon to work on this app. The app came out to be decent, considering it was my first app that I built without following a tutorial.

It _just_ worked, although it was laden with bugs.

I worked on it on 27<sup>th</sup>, but it was some minor changes.

It was publised on GitHub at [flyingcakes85/midori](https://github.com/flyingcakes85/midori).

## March/April

I don't know when this happened, but some time in March or April, I decided to resume working on this app. This time, the app would close unexpectedly because of some bug. (which I never found out) After spending about maybe an hour or two trying to figure out what was wrong, I gave up. I renamed the GitHub repository from `midori` to `midori_old`. I had decided to rewrite the app. The decision wasn't difficult, since writing the original version took me two days. So rewriting wouldn't have been a major time investment.

The rewrite never happened.

## May 25th

Two months later from the day when I made my first commit to the original Midori, I sat down to rewrite it. Just for some satisfaction, I decided to try building the original code one last time. It failed, outputting some error messages. I posted a short message about this on a group where we have seniors from my college, and then created a new Flutter project for the rewrite.

An hour into the rewrite, a senior suggested running `flutter pub upgrade`, and it worked. Why did I not do this essential thing all these days? No idea. I studied these basic commands, but never actually updated dependencies.

Woof! I had been worried for no reason!

I made quite a few commits on March 26<sup>th</sup>. The app now works, and there aren't any bugs that I am aware of. I still need to verify if the Romaji map is correct. I also plan to add some sort of learning feature. That will take another few days.

I will hopefully complete it soon and release on the Play Store.
