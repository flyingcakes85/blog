To get the latest posts from this blog delivered right on your phone, so that you don't have to open this website again and again, you can use RSS feed. Below is the link to this blog's RSS feed:
[https://flyingcakes85.github.io/blog/feed.xml](https://flyingcakes85.github.io/blog/feed.xml)
This is also on the footer of every blog post.

Download an app like [Aggregator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tughi.aggregator) that allows you to follow RSS feeds. Copy my feed link and add it to Aggregator. You can use any RSS reader of your choice. I suggested Aggregator because it does not require any sign up and has dark mode :)
