Yo! This is the first post here.

I initially planned to use a minimal theme and modify
it to my liking. Down the line, I realised how bad my
web dev skills are. So I switched to using a pre baked
theme.

I'll post mostly tech related content. But beware, I
also like music and am studying Japanese language.
Expect to see random non tech stuff here ;-)

I need to improve the theme a bit (not happy with font sizes).
Will do that soon.
